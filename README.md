## General Info
The "SOL Ecosystem" project arises as an initiative to efficiently and collaboratively integrate several independent projects, each developed as a *microfrontend using Vue 3*. The integration is done through the powerful technology of *Module Federation*, allowing the construction of a comprehensive system for the management of shipping logistics.

continuous deployment was implemented for each project using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Main Components:

### 1. Sol Server
It functions as the centralized source of data for the ecosystem, providing the necessary information for efficient shipment management. This is only a server for testing purposes, it is developed with JSON-Server. to see more please visit the [Repository](https://github.com/andybolano/sol-server).

### 2. UI Sol Shared Library:
Contains shared user interface (UI) components that ensure consistency and visual coherence across all microfrontends of the system. Facilitates agile development and uniform interface updates. [View Project](https://github.com/andybolano/sol-shared-library).

### 3. Sol Trip Management:
This microfrontend specializes in trip management, offering a complete listing where users can view, create and edit trips. It provides an intuitive interface to optimize shipment-related operations. [View Project](https://github.com/andybolano/sol-tripManagement).

### 4. Shell:
Acts as the integrating layer of the project, combining the different microfrontends in a harmonious way. Provides a cohesive user experience by combining the functionalities of the different independent projects. [View Project](https://github.com/andybolano/shell/).

### 5. Sol Ecosystem:
The central project that brings together and coordinates all integrated repositories. It represents the culmination of integration, offering a complete and robust system for the efficient management of shipping logistics.

With the SOL Ecosystem project, we seek to optimize shipment logistics management by leveraging the modularity of microfrontends and the seamless integration between them. This approach not only improves development efficiency, but also provides a consistent and engaging user experience.

#### Important üì¢:
you should know that this project is using the **microfrontend architecture**, making use of an external project called [sol-trip-management](https://sol-trip-management.netlify.app/#/trip/list) to load the trip module.

Here you can see a small scheme to better understand the architecture of this project.
